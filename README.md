# ViralPurpurs

**EDIT: CURRENTLY REDESIGNING**

Turns out the core functionality I had planned is infeasible, since there's not a good way to make 'viral' blocks perform the infection behavior every tick. Target selectors only select players or entities, can't use them to grab arbitrary blocks sadly. Looks like I need to go back to the drawing board and come up something more entity-centric. Best idea I've had so far is creating *small* numbers of armor stands or player heads which will then continually fill the space around them with blocks. The trick is going to be making their survival tied to the amount of purpur stuff around them. Perhaps I should make them indestructible so long as there are purpur blocks within a certain range of them?

This data pack is inspired by my experiences playing Talonos's excellent [Blightfall](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/blightfall.592618) modpack many years ago. It aims to convey the same tension and dread I felt hiding in my glass dome, surrounded by oceans of deadly Taint.

While the pack is titled "Viral Purpurs", it should be posssible to apply viral behavior to any block(s) of your choice by doing some light editing.

Note: I take no responsibility for damage this pack causes to your world! Take particular care if you've placed Purpur blocks near anything important, or vice-versa. Once data packs become more powerful I might be able to add ways of "curing" large outbreaks, but don't expect anything anytime soon. 

*Currently a work in progress.*
