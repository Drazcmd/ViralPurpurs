This data pack is inspired by my experiences playing the [Blightfall](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/blightfall.592618) modpack many years ago. It aims to convey the same tension and dread I felt hiding in my glass dome, surrounded by oceans of deadly Taint.

While the pack is titled "Viral Purpurs", it should be posssible to apply viral behavior to any block(s) of your choice by editing the tags.

*Currently a work in progress.* 

Note: I take no responsibility damage that purpur infections may cause to your world (in fact, that's the main point of this mod ^^)
