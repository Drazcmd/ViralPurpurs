This data pack is inspired by my experiences playing Talonos's excellent [Blightfall](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/blightfall.592618) modpack many years ago. It aims to convey the same tension and dread I felt hiding in my glass dome, surrounded by oceans of deadly Taint.

While the pack is titled "Viral Purpurs", it should be posssible to apply viral behavior to any block(s) of your choice by editing the tags.

Note: I take no responsibility for damage this pack causes to your world! Take particular care if you've placed Purpur blocks near anything important, or vice-versa. Once data packs become more powerful I might be able to add ways of "curing" large outbreaks, but don't expect anything anytime soon. 

*Currently a work in progress.*
